I am a Full Professor at the [Departamento de Computación](https://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar), [FCEFQyN](https://www.exa.unrc.edu.ar), [Universidad Nacional de Río Cuarto](https://www.unrc.edu.ar), and an Independent Researcher at [Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET)](https://conicet.gov.ar). I am also a Visiting Professor at [Guangdong Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.gtiit.edu.cn), Shantou, China.

[//]: # (I graduated as Analista en Computación in 1997 and as Licenciado en Ciencias de la Computación in 1999, both at the [Departamento de Computación](https://dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar), [Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Físico-Químicas y Naturales](https://www.exa.unrc.edu.ar), [Universidad Nacional de Río Cuarto](https://www.unrc.edu.ar). In 2004 I got my PhD at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk), University of London.)

My main research interests correspond to Software Engineering, in particular Formal Methods for Software Development. I currently work on formal analyses of software based on SAT solving, including specification inference, test generation, bounded verification and program repair. The main aim of my research is to help build reliable quality software.
