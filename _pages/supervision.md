Currently, I supervise or co-supervise several undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoc research associates and researchers. In the Formal Methods and Software Engineering Research Group we are constantly looking for students willing to do their final projects in the context of the group’s research interests. Students interested in software analysis, testing, formal methods, theory of computer science, software engineering, and related subjects, please contact me via email or personally. We are rather flexible in defining topics for final projects and theses, and we have several interesting proposals. 

The students and postdocs that I currently supervise and had supervised are detailed below.
